11.	Check EXP() in library_fixed.h and arduino/library.h

1.	inputVar in IR.Var is redundant. You can do that check using self.globalVars as well. Remove it.
2.	internalVar in IR.Var is never used. Remove it.
3.	The current code generation process involves creating temp memory only when it is required. If the operation can be performed in-place, no memory is created. Make this clear somewhere.
4.	Add debug statements everywhere to show more information about the compilation like how the scale and the interval values change at each operator.
5.	Use tree sum in sparse matrix multiplication as well. Currently not being used.
6.	Check all the 'TODO's.
7.	Re-check visitExp().
8.	Add another version of tree sum where precision is not lost
9.	Re-write getScale(), getScaleForExp(), getScaleAndIntervalForAdd(), getIntervalForExp() function.
10.	Write getScaleAndIntervalForSub()
11.	Rewrite reading mutableVarsProfile similar to expProfile. Read once, store and reuse instead of reading at each mutable var.
12.	Add self.log.print() statements at every operation.
13.	Try trimming the model parameters as well and see if there are any significant scale changes
